# CRUDFunctionality-Js
Back-end only attempt
CRUD in JS involves creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in a database. "Create" inserts new data, "Read" retrieves data, "Update" modifies existing data, and "Delete" removes data. Each operation requires proper handling of user input and execution of JS queries to interact with mongoDB.

This project works with 3 collections allowing for crud functionality for all. Based on a database for a store keeping data about customer, items and orders.

//node-modules are required to run this
